# CIS 600 - Research Idea

The Netherlands faces a major challenge in reducing residential natural gas consumption. Over 90% of Dutch homes use natural gas for heating and hot water, making households responsible for approximately 25% of natural gas demand (International Energy Agency 2020; ECN part of TNO 2017). The government aims to phase out natural gas from buildings by 2050, with all new homes required to be gas-free since 2018 (CE Delft 2021). Meeting these goals requires understanding what drives consumption and how it varies accross regions.

**Main Reseach Question:** How accurately can machine learning models predict residential natural gas consumption at the muncipal level in the Netherlands?

**Sub-questions:**
- **RQ1:** Which machine learning approach achieves the highest prediction accuracy for muncipal gas consumption forecasting?
- **RQ2:** What is the relative importance of housing characteristics, socio-economic factors, and energy consumption patterns in predicting gas consumption?
- **RQ3:** How do prediction accuracy and feature importance vary across different types of Dutch muncipalities?
